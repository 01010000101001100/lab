## Teehan+Lax navigation
This demo recreates the navigation of [Teehan+Lax](http://www.teehanlax.com). I reverse engineered their menu and wrote my own code to achieve similar functionality. Read more about it in [this blog post](http://alexcican.com/post/teehan-lax-navigation/).

### How it works
The navigation bar is being hidden once you start scrolling. As soon as you scroll up a few pixels it is shown. After that, when you scroll down again it gets hidden. When you have reached the bottom of this page the main menu reappears.

### Improvements over original:
* Navigate only with keyboard (Tab + Enter / Space).
* Keyboard shortcuts (Esc / M).
* Firefox animation fix.
* Close navigation by clicking anywhere outside link area.
* iOS 7 like blurring of background.
